# Pulsar recognition

The goal of this study is to test different models and find a good one for the classification of the pulsars, which are a type of Neutron star that release a pattern of broadband radio emission that we can detect from Earth. The dataset used in this project is the HTRU2, taken from the UCI repository.
It contains a group pulsar candidates. They are of considerable scientific interest as probes of spacetime, the inter-stellar medium, and states of matter.

## Info

Source files are in the "src" folder.
The other directories are necessary because the source code saves and loads data from them.
The pdf file contains the paper of the study
